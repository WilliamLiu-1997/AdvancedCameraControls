# CameraControl 
An update of OrbitControls in three.js. 

## Updates:
1. The zooming of PerspectiveCamera is replaced with panning forward and backward. Therefore, this component can be used to move the PerspectiveCamera to six direction including forward, backward, up, down, left and right from current perspective.
2. The rotation will be conducted using the PerspectiveCamera as the center.
